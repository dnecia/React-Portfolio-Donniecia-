      <p>Hi I am currently a registered pharmacist in New York. I became 
          interested in web development over the past few months and decided to enroll in Columbia Engineering's Full Stack Web Development Course. Gaining skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, my hopes are to 
          intertwine this with my experience in pharmacy.</p>
